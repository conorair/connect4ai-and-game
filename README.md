# connect4ai-and-game

My attempt to make a AI + game with the minimax was based on this C++ tutorial http://blog.gamesolver.org/solving-connect-four/03-minmax/#:~:text=The%20MinMax%20algorithm,that%20will%20maximize%20your%20score.
Pygame was helped with this https://www.youtube.com/kgmit


This was a stepping stone to my goal to make a chess one.

This was written in pycharm python 3.9.

has been working on this for 3 months.

orignal is the first game 

Working connect 4 is the first working game

AI1 was the first attempt and worked in someways but sometimes the gravity function was broken and sometimes the AI would die also there was a attemt to use colours

AI3 tried to patch AI1 and 2 but didnt fully work.

AI3.2 was when all the functions worked as intended but was a ugly text based game.

AI3.2 graphics is being worked on and is AI3.2 + pygame graphics with help from https://www.youtube.com/kgmit
