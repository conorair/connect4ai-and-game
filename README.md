# connect4ai-and-game

My attempt to make a AI + game with the minimax was based on this C++ tutorial http://blog.gamesolver.org/solving-connect-four/03-minmax/#:~:text=The%20MinMax%20algorithm,that%20will%20maximize%20your%20score.
Pygame graphics was helped with this tutorial https://www.youtube.com/kgmit\
And this documentation https://www.pygame.org/docs/

this is python.

orignal is the first game 

Working connect 4 is the first working game it was spossed to have the engine implemented but was never accieved 

V1 was the first attempt and worked in someways but sometimes the gravity function was broken and sometimes the AI would die also there was a attemt to use colours

V3 tried to patch AI1 and 2 but didnt fully work.

V3.2 was when the engine managed to work and move check was added.
V3.2 graphics is being worked on and is AI3.2 + pygame graphics with help from https://www.youtube.com/kgmit
